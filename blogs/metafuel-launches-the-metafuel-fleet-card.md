Introducing: **[MetaFuel](http://getmetafuel.com)**, an intuitive fleet finance & fuel tax management platform transforming the trucking industry. It all started with the innovative **IFTA Pro** fuel tax engine that turned the tedious, error-prone, and mundane process of managing IFTA compliance into a streamlined and automated workflow powered by modern technology. 

## **Powering the Future of Fleet Management with the MetaFuel Card**

Building on this robust data platform, MetaFuel has partnered with **Stripe** to bring you the **MetaFuel Card**—a next-generation Fleet card* designed to manage and control fleet expenses, from fuel to tires.

### **Why the MetaFuel Card Stands Out**

The Iowa-based startup MetaFuel is offering the MetaFuel Card as a **low-fee fleet card**, providing exceptional value and convenience to local and long-haul trucking fleets as well as any fleet of vehicles.

As a universally accepted **Visa Fleet Card**, it comes with a wide range of benefits, including:

- Free IFTA Pro access — fuel tax automation and reporting
- Integrated telematics insights
- Up to .5% back on all transactions, fuel & fleet, with no limits
- Card-level controls on where purchases are made
- Universal pump acceptance anywhere that takes Visa

### **Solving Key Pain Points for Fleet Managers**

The MetaFuel Card addresses key pain points by:

- Eliminating the need for physical receipts
- Streamlining fuel spend management
- Integrated insights between telematics & fuel

This ensures operational efficiency and peace of mind for fleet managers.

### **Unbeatable Launch Promotion for Early Adopters**

The launch promotion offers the opportunity to lock in an entirely **less-fee pricing model** for early adopters — no monthly, transaction or service fees & the first card is free for each asset. This makes MetaFuel Card an unbeatable choice for fleets looking to optimize their operations, streamline compliance, and confidently enter the data-driven operations space.
